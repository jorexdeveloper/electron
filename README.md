## Features

-   **Natural Language Understanding**: Communicate with Electron using natural language.
-   **Inbuilt Terminal Support**: Send commands to your terminal using Electron.
-   **API Integration**: Connect with various APIs and tools for enhanced functionality.
-   **Customizable Workflows**: Tailor commands and workflows to suit your needs.

## Getting Started

Get a free/paid AI/ML API key from [here](/link_here "AI/ML website") and save it somewhere, you will need it for authenticatication while using the assistant.

### Installation

Now open your terminal and:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jorexdeveloper/electron.git
    ```
    Or download and extract files from the [latest release](/link_here "The latest release of Electron.").
2. Navigate to the project directory and execute the installer:
    ```bash
    bash electron/install.sh
    ```
    This will interactively install everything in the repository directory, so that you can rename and move it anywhere without any conflicts.

### Configuration

Electron requires a configuration file (`settings.json`) to function properly, but don't worry, a new ome with default values will be created if it's missing You can customize the following keys:

-   **`model`**: The AI model to use (default: `gpt-4o-mini`).
-   **`api_key`**: Your API key for authentication. If left empty, its got from the environment as `API_KEY`
-   **`system_message`**: The assistant's context message.
-   **`assistant_name`**: The name of the assistant (default: `Electron`).
-   **`user_name`**: Your name for personalized interactions.

## üíª Usage

### Basic Commands

Run the Electron assistant using the following command:

```bash
python electron.py
```

Once running, you can interact with Electron using natural language commands. For example:

```bash
> What is the weather today?
> Create a new file named "example.txt".
```

### Advanced Usage

-   **View Interaction History**:
    ```bash
    history
    history 5
    ```
-   **Exit Commands**:
    Use any of the following commands to exit:
    ```bash
    q, quit, exit, bye, close, stop
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

-   **Missing API Key**:
    If you see an error about a missing API key, ensure you have set it in the `settings.json` file or as an environment variable.

-   **Connection Errors**:
    Check your internet connection and ensure the API endpoint is reachable.

## ‚ùì FAQ

### What happens if I don't set an API key?

Electron requires an API key to function. If the key is missing, you will be prompted to provide one during the first run.

### Can I customize the assistant's name?

Yes! You can change the assistant's name by editing the `assistant_name` field in the `settings.json` file.
